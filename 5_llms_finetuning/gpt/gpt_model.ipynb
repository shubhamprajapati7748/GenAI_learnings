            "The Champions Trophy in cricket is a short-lived international cricket tournament that features One Day International (ODI) matches. It used to involve a series of national teams competing for the title, and it was generally held every two to four years. The tournament was known for its round-robin format followed by knockout stages, although this varied in different editions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Differences Between the Champions Trophy and the World Cup:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Frequency and Format**:\n",
            "   - **Champions Trophy**: Held less frequently than the World Cup, typically every 2-4 years, and it usually involved fewer teams (8 in recent editions). The format sometimes involved round-robin matches leading to semi-finals and a final.\n",
            "   - **World Cup**: The ICC Cricket World Cup is held every four years and involves a larger number of teams (often 10-14 in recent editions). It features group stages leading into knockout rounds, culminating in a final.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Historical Significance**:\n",
            "   - **Champions Trophy**: It was initially established as the ICC KnockOut tournament in 1998 and was rebranded as the Champions Trophy in 2002. It was seen as a prestigious but secondary tournament compared to the World Cup.\n",
            "   - **World Cup**: The ICC Cricket World Cup, first held in 1975, is the most prestigious tournament in international cricket, akin to the FIFA World Cup in football. It is widely recognized and is the pinnacle of ODI cricket.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Tournament Goals**:\n",
            "   - **Champions Trophy**: Aimed at providing competitive and high-quality cricket in a shorter format with fewer teams and a more concentrated timeframe.\n",
            "   - **World Cup**: Aims to crown the best international team in cricket across a wider participation base and over a longer duration.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Legacy**:\n",
            "   - The Champions Trophy has been discontinued after 2017, with the ICC focusing on other ODI formats, including the World Cup and World Test Championship. The last tournament took place in England in 2017, where Pakistan triumphed over India in the final.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the Champions Trophy was a significant, albeit secondary, tournament in the ODI format of cricket distinguished from the ICC Cricket World Cup by its frequency, number of participating teams, and overall prestige.\n"
